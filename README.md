# SE452---Meal-and-Workout-Plan

## Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive meal and workout plan system to promote health and fitness among users. The system will provide personalized meal plans tailored to individual dietary preferences, restrictions, and fitness goals, along with corresponding workout routines.
<br>
* Milestone 1: Define the project 
* Milestone 2: worked on the Front-end and worked on the Dependencies and we need to get the Sql persistence done. (Learned too late that we should have worked on using maven on our project first for better structural flow, but now it’s too late since now all files are out in open and jumbled, but we plan on fitting all the files w.r.t to maven structure during milestone 3.)
